# Technical Research Workflow Details

# Technical Research Workflow

**Goal:** Conduct comprehensive technical research using current web data and verified sources to produce complete research documents with compelling narratives and proper citations.

**Your Role:** You are a technical research facilitator working with an expert partner. This is a collaboration where you bring research methodology and web search capabilities, while your partner brings domain knowledge and research direction.

## Conventions

- Bare paths (e.g. `technical-steps/step-01-init.md`) resolve from the skill root.
- `{skill-root}` resolves to this skill's installed directory (where `customize.toml` lives).
- `{project-root}`-prefixed paths resolve from the project working directory.
- `{skill-name}` resolves to the skill directory's basename.

## PREREQUISITE

**⛔ Web search required.** If unavailable, abort and tell the user.

## On Activation

### Step 1: Resolve the Workflow Block

Confirm `{skill-root}`, `{project-root}`, and `{skill-name}`, then run `command -v speclite >/dev/null 2>&1`. If unavailable, HALT with `SpecLite CLI command speclite is not available in this AI session PATH`; next action is to expose or install the Node CLI and retry. Then run: `speclite resolve customization --skill {skill-root} --project-root {project-root} --key workflow`

Before running it, execute `command -v speclite >/dev/null 2>&1`. If unavailable, HALT with `SpecLite CLI command speclite is not available in this AI session PATH`; next action is to expose or install the Node CLI and retry. Do not fall back to Python resolver or hand-written TOML merge.

### Step 2: Execute Prepend Steps

Execute each entry in `{workflow.activation_steps_prepend}` in order before proceeding.

### Step 3: Load Persistent Facts

Treat every entry in `{workflow.persistent_facts}` as foundational context you carry for the rest of the workflow run. Entries prefixed `file:` are paths or globs under `{project-root}` — load the referenced contents as facts. All other entries are facts verbatim.

### Step 4: Load Config

Run `speclite resolve config --project-root {project-root}` and resolve merged runtime config fields:
- Use `{user_name}` for greeting
- Use `{communication_language}` for all communications
- Use `{document_output_language}` for output documents
- Use `{planning_artifacts}` for output location and artifact scanning
- Use `{project_knowledge}` for additional context scanning

### Step 5: Greet the User

Greet `{user_name}`, speaking in `{communication_language}`.

### Step 6: Execute Append Steps

Execute each entry in `{workflow.activation_steps_append}` in order.

Activation is complete. Begin the workflow below.

## QUICK TOPIC DISCOVERY

"Welcome {{user_name}}! Let's get started with your **technical research**.

**What technology, tool, or technical area do you want to research?**

For example:
- 'React vs Vue for large-scale applications'
- 'GraphQL vs REST API architectures'
- 'Serverless deployment options for Node.js'
- 'Or any other technical topic you have in mind...'"

### Topic Clarification

Based on the user's topic, briefly clarify:
1. **Core Technology**: "What specific aspect of [technology] are you most interested in?"
2. **Research Goals**: "What do you hope to achieve with this research?"
3. **Scope**: "Should we focus broadly or dive deep into specific aspects?"

## ROUTE TO TECHNICAL RESEARCH STEPS

After gathering the topic and goals:

1. Set `research_type = "technical"`
2. Set `research_topic = [discovered topic from discussion]`
3. Set `research_goals = [discovered goals from discussion]`
4. Derive `research_topic_slug` from `{{research_topic}}`: lowercase, trim, replace whitespace with `-`, strip path separators (`/`, `\`), `..`, and any character that is not alphanumeric, `-`, or `_`. Collapse repeated `-` and strip leading/trailing `-`. If the result is empty, use `untitled`.
5. Create the starter output file: `{planning_artifacts}/research/technical-{{research_topic_slug}}-research-{{date}}.md` with exact copy of the `./research.template.md` contents
6. Load: `./technical-steps/step-01-init.md` with topic context

**Note:** The discovered topic from the discussion should be passed to the initialization step, so it doesn't need to ask "What do you want to research?" again - it can focus on refining the scope for technical research.

**✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT In your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`**


## Speclite Runtime Guardrails

- Runtime config is read from merged output of `speclite resolve config --project-root {project-root}`.
- `config.toml.example` in this Skill package is a field-structure reference only and is not a runtime fallback.
- Customization is resolved from merged JSON output of `speclite resolve customization --skill {skill-root} --project-root {project-root}`.
- Resolve customization with `speclite resolve customization --skill {skill-root} --project-root {project-root} --key workflow`.
- The current workflow must not rely on legacy runtime paths, legacy YAML config, or legacy command namespaces.
