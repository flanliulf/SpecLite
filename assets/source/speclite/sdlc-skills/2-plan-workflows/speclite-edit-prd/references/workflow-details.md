# Edit PRD Workflow Details

# PRD Edit Workflow

**Goal:** Edit and improve existing PRDs through structured enhancement workflow.

**Your Role:** PRD improvement specialist.

You will continue to operate with your given name, identity, and communication_style, merged with the details of this role description.

## Conventions

- Bare paths (e.g. `steps-e/step-e-01-discovery.md`) resolve from the skill root.
- `{skill-root}` resolves to this skill's installed directory (where `customize.toml` lives).
- `{project-root}`-prefixed paths resolve from the project working directory.
- `{skill-name}` resolves to the skill directory's basename.

## WORKFLOW ARCHITECTURE

This uses **step-file architecture** for disciplined execution:

### Core Principles

- **Micro-file Design**: Each step is a self-contained instruction file that is a part of an overall workflow that must be followed exactly
- **Just-In-Time Loading**: Only the current step file is in memory - never load future step files until told to do so
- **Sequential Enforcement**: Sequence within the step files must be completed in order, no skipping or optimization allowed
- **State Tracking**: Document progress in output file frontmatter using `stepsCompleted` array when a workflow produces a document
- **Append-Only Building**: Build documents by appending content as directed to the output file

### Step Processing Rules

1. **READ COMPLETELY**: Always read the entire step file before taking any action
2. **FOLLOW SEQUENCE**: Execute all numbered sections in order, never deviate
3. **WAIT FOR INPUT**: If a menu is presented, halt and wait for user selection
4. **CHECK CONTINUATION**: If the step has a menu with Continue as an option, only proceed to next step when user selects 'C' (Continue)
5. **SAVE STATE**: Update `stepsCompleted` in frontmatter before loading next step
6. **LOAD NEXT**: When directed, read fully and follow the next step file

### Critical Rules (NO EXCEPTIONS)

- 🛑 **NEVER** load multiple step files simultaneously
- 📖 **ALWAYS** read entire step file before execution
- 🚫 **NEVER** skip steps or optimize the sequence
- 💾 **ALWAYS** update frontmatter of output files when writing the final output for a specific step
- 🎯 **ALWAYS** follow the exact instructions in the step file
- ⏸️ **ALWAYS** halt at menus and wait for user input
- 📋 **NEVER** create mental todo lists from future steps

## On Activation

### Step 1: Resolve the Workflow Block

Confirm `{skill-root}`, `{project-root}`, and `{skill-name}`, then run `command -v speclite >/dev/null 2>&1`. If unavailable, HALT with `SpecLite CLI command speclite is not available in this AI session PATH`; next action is to expose or install the Node CLI and retry. Then run: `speclite resolve customization --skill {skill-root} --project-root {project-root} --key workflow`

Before running it, execute `command -v speclite >/dev/null 2>&1`. If unavailable, HALT with `SpecLite CLI command speclite is not available in this AI session PATH`; next action is to expose or install the Node CLI and retry. Do not fall back to Python resolver or hand-written TOML merge.

### Step 2: Execute Prepend Steps

Execute each entry in `{workflow.activation_steps_prepend}` in order before proceeding.

### Step 3: Load Persistent Facts

Treat every entry in `{workflow.persistent_facts}` as foundational context you carry for the rest of the workflow run. Entries prefixed `file:` are paths or globs under `{project-root}` — load the referenced contents as facts. All other entries are facts verbatim.

### Step 4: Load Config

Run `speclite resolve config --project-root {project-root}` and resolve merged runtime config fields:
- Use `{user_name}` for greeting
- Use `{communication_language}` for all communications
- Use `{document_output_language}` for output documents
- Use `{planning_artifacts}` for output location and artifact scanning
- Use `{project_knowledge}` for additional context scanning

### Step 5: Greet the User

Greet `{user_name}`, speaking in `{communication_language}`.

### Step 6: Execute Append Steps

Execute each entry in `{workflow.activation_steps_append}` in order.

Activation is complete. Begin the workflow below.

## Execution

✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT In your Agent communication style with the configured `{communication_language}`.
✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS WRITE all artifact and document content in `{document_output_language}`.

**Edit Mode: Improving an existing PRD.**

Prompt for PRD path: "Which PRD would you like to edit? Please provide the path to the PRD.md file."

Then read fully and follow: `./steps-e/step-e-01-discovery.md`


## Speclite Runtime Guardrails

- Runtime config is read from merged output of `speclite resolve config --project-root {project-root}`.
- `config.toml.example` in this Skill package is a field-structure reference only and is not a runtime fallback.
- Customization is resolved from merged JSON output of `speclite resolve customization --skill {skill-root} --project-root {project-root}`.
- Resolve customization with `speclite resolve customization --skill {skill-root} --project-root {project-root} --key workflow`.
- The current workflow must not rely on legacy runtime paths, legacy YAML config, or legacy command namespaces.
